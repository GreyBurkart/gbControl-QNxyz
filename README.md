[QuNeo](http://www.keithmcmillen.com/QuNeo/overview) gbControl layout. This uses and abuses QuNeo's v1.2 software/firmware to show off multiple banks, x/y controllers, mixed grids and drum pads, pressure control, and so on.

If you can use MIDI Learn, there's fun to be had in any number of interesting combined controls here.
